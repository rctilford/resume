### Introduction

I wanted to make some slick effects for the website so it looks more professional. I found a tutorial on pinterest for a zoom effect on hover. However, I ran into several problems when I applied the code so I will show how I fixed those problems here.

### Finding the Element
In order to make any changes to the element we have to find it's container. To do this we need to open the developer tools our browser while we are viewing the webpage we want to modify.
